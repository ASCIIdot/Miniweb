            <p>This website is dedicated to documenting projects that I am currently working on. It will include walkthroughs of my processes, guide i may have followed, general resources that I have used, and my final results. It will be somewhat of a portfolio,
                one that is more visually interesting than GitHub and geared towards my novice works.</p>
